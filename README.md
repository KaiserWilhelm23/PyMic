# PyMic
Created By Will Payne

# Why

Well he didnt have a working mic to use on discord so he made this instead as a backup 

# Requirments

Well Will was nice enough to program this thing to auto install every bit of crap it needs. Except voicemod. Install that dont even make an account with them. Than you can use the Virtual Microphone it comes with.
